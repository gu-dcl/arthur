arthur_demo_05,,MQi0wcmYA0I,History of the Britons [Historia Brittonum],video/mpeg,"Written in the first quarter of the 9th century, <i>Historia Brittonum</i>, or <i>The History of the Britons</i>, is a historical chronical of the native peoples of the British Isles (the Britons) attributed to the Welsh monk Nennius. The text begins with the settlement of Britan by the Trojan Brutus and situates a British historical tradition within the classical epic literature of the Greeks (the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>) and Romans (the <Aeneid</i>). Among the chronology of kings, a <i>Life of St. Patrick</i>, and other tales both historical and fantastic, the story of King Arthur appears for the first time.<br /><br /> In the <i>Historia Brittonum</i> King Arthur appears as a ""dux bellorum"" (commander of a Roman expeditionary force), and not ""rex"" (king), and the narrative details a series of twelve battles fought by Arthur and other kings of Britain against Saxon tribes.<br /><br />The text of this audio recording is based on the 1847 English translation by J.A. Giles, and recorded by BUAES and Amy Gramour in 2010.

arthur_demo_07,archer_arthur.jpg,,La mort d'Arthur,image/jpg,"This painting by James Archer (1823-1904) visualizes the death of King Arthur after the Battle of Camlann. In the painting, Arthur is attended to by four women, one of whom is Guinevere, his queen. In the background on the left, Merlin and Nimue can be seen along the shore of a body of water, while on the right a ship awaits and a ghostly spirit holds the Holy Grail.<br /><br />The oil painting, completed in 1860, was acquired by the Manchester Art Gallery in 1952, a generous gift from L. A. Haworth. It belongs to a series of Arthurian-inspired paintings done by Archer beginning around 1859, all heavily influenced by the art and literature of the Romantics and Victorians.","Archer, James",,1860,no,image; painting,King Arthur; Art; ,London; Manchester,51.508559847867865,-0.11464493570048674,,ArtUK,https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/la-mort-darthur-204376,,la-mort-darthur-204376,archer_arthur,CC BY-NC-ND,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Image,,
